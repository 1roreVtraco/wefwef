AutoCAD 2014 is not only a powerful design software, but also a versatile one that offers many tips and tricks to make your work easier and faster. Here are some of them that you may find useful.
 
### Use Command Line Enhancements
 
The command line in AutoCAD 2014 has several new enhancements, such as transparency, content search, and autocorrect. You can adjust the transparency of the command line by dragging the slider on the right side of the command line. You can also search for commands, system variables, and other content by typing keywords in the command line. The autocorrect feature will automatically correct common spelling errors and suggest synonyms for commands. You can also access the input settings dialog box by clicking on the wrench icon on the left side of the command line[^1^].

### Merge Layers with Layer Manager
 
If you want to merge two or more layers into one, you can use the Layer Merge tool in the Layer Manager. This tool allows you to select multiple layers and merge them into a target layer, while deleting the source layers. To use this tool, follow these steps:

1. Open the Layer Properties Manager by clicking on the Layer Properties icon on the ribbon or typing LAYER in the command line.
2. Select the layers you want to merge by holding down Ctrl or Shift key.
3. Right-click on one of the selected layers and choose Merge Selected Layers To... from the context menu.
4. Select a target layer from the list or create a new one by typing a name.
5. Click OK to confirm.

The selected layers will be merged into the target layer and deleted from the drawing[^1^].
 
### Use File Tabs to Switch Between Drawings
 
File tabs are a new feature in AutoCAD 2014 that allow you to switch between open drawings easily. You can see a file tab for each open drawing at the top of your drawing area. You can click on a file tab to activate that drawing, or right-click on a file tab to access more options, such as save, close, copy, rename, etc. You can also drag and drop file tabs to reorder them or move them to another monitor. To turn on or off file tabs, go to View tab > Interface panel > File Tabs[^4^].
