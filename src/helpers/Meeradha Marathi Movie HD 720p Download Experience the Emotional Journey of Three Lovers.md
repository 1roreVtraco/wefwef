Meeradha is a film that tries to capture the essence of the timeless love story of Radha and Krishna, who are considered to be the epitome of divine love in Hindu mythology. The film draws parallels between the ancient and the modern times, and shows how love transcends time and space. The film also explores the concept of reincarnation and fate, and how they affect the lives of the lovers.

Meeradha is a film that has a lot of potential, but fails to deliver on its promise. The film suffers from a weak script, poor direction and lack of originality. The film tries to be a grand epic, but ends up being a dull and boring affair. The film does not do justice to the rich and complex mythology of Radha and Krishna, and instead resorts to clichÃ©s and stereotypes. The film also fails to create any chemistry or emotion between the lead actors, who look wooden and unconvincing in their roles.
 
The only saving grace of the film is its music, which is melodious and soothing. The songs are well-composed and well-sung, and add some charm to the film. The cinematography is also decent, and captures the beauty of the locations. The film has some good visuals and effects, but they are not enough to make up for the flaws in the story and the execution.
