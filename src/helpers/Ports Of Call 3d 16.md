- Manage the finances wisely. The player should keep an eye on the income and expenses of the company, as well as the loans and interest rates. The player should try to make a profit by buying low and selling high, as well as negotiating good deals with customers and suppliers. The player should also save some money for emergencies, such as repairs, refueling or fines.
